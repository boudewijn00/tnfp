it started as a simple hobby script to calc the time between entries (events) in google calendar. to make a kid-friendly calendar for co-parents. 
working example can be seen at http://thenewfamily.nl/calendar/week/demo/1. i placed the main logic as a lib and want to make it more OOP 
(apply some design pattern, better seperation of concerns) and Testable (PHPUnit)
